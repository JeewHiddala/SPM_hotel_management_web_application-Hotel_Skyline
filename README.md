This project aims at creating a Hotel Management System for Hotel SkyLight which enables the hotel staff and the customers to perform their needs efficiently in a user-friendly manner. There are 4 main user roles identified namely; customer, receptionist, kitchen head and hotel manager. Customers must register and login to the system to use the services. Then they can book rooms/ halls and place food orders. The receptionist can also create room/ hall bookings for customers. After customers have checked in to the hotel, the receptionist can maintain a service list in order to keep track of the services used by the customers during their stay at the hotel. This can be utilized when calculating their service bill at the end of their stay. When customers check out from the hotel, the receptionist can generate the bill including the room cost and cost for services used. Receptionists can enter payments made by customers to the system. Apart from that, the task of recording the attendance of hotel employees is also done by the receptionist. Also, they can generate reports on food orders & billing details of customers so that the hotel management to have a clear view about the food orders, room details and service details. The kitchen head is the one in charge of the kitchen. He is responsible for adding the types of food and beverages that are offered by the hotel to the system food list so that customers can select and order their food. He can also manage ingredient orders so that the kitchen will have sufficient supplies to prepare the various kinds of food items. A report can be generated by the kitchen head to get details about ingredient orders made so that he/ she can make relevant decisions on upcoming orders. The hotel manager is responsible for managing rooms and services offered by the hotel. Apart from that, he will be maintaining the details of the employees in the hotel and he will create logins for the employees who use the system.
